# Completion checklist

- If changing scripts/config, ensure CLI usage in README and docstrings stays accurate.
- No dedicated lint/test config is present; run the relevant script(s) manually if validation is needed.
- If outputs are expected, verify YAML in bin/<gamever>/... and gamedata outputs in dist/...
