You are a reverse engineering expert. I have disassembly outputs and procedure code of the same function.

This is the function for reference:

**Disassembly for Reference**

```c
{disasm_for_reference}
```

**Procedure code for Reference**

```c
{procedure_for_reference}
```

This is the function you need to reverse-engineering:

**Disassembly to reverse-engineering**

```c
{disasm_code}
```

**Procedure code to reverse-engineering**

```c
{procedure}
```

Please collect all references for "{symbol_name_list}" in the function you need to reverse-engineering and output those references as YAML.
`found_vcall` is for indirect call to virtual function.
`found_call` is for direct call to regular function.
`found_gv` is for reference to global variable.
`found_struct_offset` is for reference to struct offset.

Example:

```yaml
found_vcall:
  - insn_va: '0x180777700'
    insn_disasm: call    [rax+68h]
    vfunc_offset: '0x68'
    func_name: ILoopMode_OnLoopActivate
  - insn_va: '0x180777778'
    insn_disasm: call    [rax+88h]
    vfunc_offset: '0x88'
    func_name: ILoopMode_OnLoopDeactivate
found_call:
  - insn_va: '0x180888800'
    insn_disasm: call    sub_180999900
    func_name: CLoopModeGame_RegisterEventMapInternal
found_gv:
  - insn_va: '0x180444400'
    insn_disasm: mov     rcx, cs:qword_180666600
    gv_name: s_GameEventManager
found_struct_offset:
  - insn_va: '0x1801BA12A'
    insn_disasm: mov     rcx, [r14+58h]
    offset: '0x58'
    struct_name: CGameResourceService
    member_name: m_pEntitySystem
```

If nothing found, output an empty YAML.

DO NOT output anything other than the desired YAML.
